									<h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>
									<p>My name is Nhat Duy Hoang but I grew up being called Duy.<br>My student number is s3785725. <br>Email: duyhoang._@hotmail.com. <br>My parents are Vietnamese but I was born and raised in Melbourne's South East (Springvale). I went to Primary school at Albany Rise Primary School and went to High School at Wellington Secondary College where I completed VCE. I mainly speak Vietnamese to my parents and English to my siblings. I have a casual job at Mcdonalds near Clayton. In my free time I like to play PS4 with my mates, go out with my mates, watch movies, eat out and play sports.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
									<p><strong>What is your interest in IT?</strong> I’m interested in how coding and programming works especially for games and applications
										<br><strong>When did your interest in IT start?</strong> It started around early last year 
<br><strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong> My older brother and cousin both studied IT and said that it was a good pathway in Uni with a good employment rate that I also found somewhat interesting after studying Systems Engineering in VCE
										<br><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong> I chose RMIT as my 2nd preference and Monash IT being my first which I didn’t get into due to a lower ATAR than the Monash Guarantee. I chose RMIT as my 2nd preference because it was in the city which is quite an annoying travel but I did hear from my careers counsellor that it was a very good university especially in the IT field
										<br><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong> I expect to learn IT skills in order to get a job that needs an IT graduate

									<p><br><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong><br>These results determine what type of learner I am and what type of person I am meant to be but I somewhat feel that some of the results are not 100% accurate.  I felt that some questions didn’t really have an answer that was 100% what I would have chosen. 
<br><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong><br>These results are basically on how I interact with others and learn so they will heavily influence my behaviour on a team. It will influence greatly on how I act with my team mates.
<br><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong><br>The results will help me by finding the right people to work. The kind of people that will keep me on track and focussed. But not to a point where the work becomes boring as I cannot stay focused on a particular task for too long. I need to have a bit of fun will doing the task or at least be doing something that I enjoy and not feel forced to do so
